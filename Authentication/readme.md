# Authentication, JWT, and Cookies from Namaste NodeJS

- All API calls should be securely authenticated. When a user provides their credentials, the server verifies them and generates a unique JWT token. This token is then wrapped within a cookie and sent to the client. The browser typically stores this cookie in session storage, ensuring that sensitive data remains secure.

- After a successful login, each subsequent API request must include this cookie, which the server validates on each request. If the cookie has expired, the server responds with a 401 Unauthorized status. Cookie expiration policies can be customized based on application requirements. Some applications enforce automatic logout after a set duration when the cookie expires, while others may extend the cookie lifespan for longer sessions.

- Previously, I worked with Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for similar purposes. After authentication, the API returns a token that we stored in session storage on the client side. This token was then included in every API request. We added an additional layer of security by encrypting the token using the crypto npm library before sending it, and decrypting it within the .NET Core-based API, where we verified the token's validity. MSAL also supports silent token acquisition through the acquireSilentToken function, which refreshes tokens automatically. This setup allows users to leave the application open and resume use without re-authentication. However, some applications require auto-logout for enhanced security, making it essential to balance user experience and security based on specific application needs.
