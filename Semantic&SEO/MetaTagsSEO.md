# SEO with Meta tags

## Meta tag with Keywords Attribute

- <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript"> These days Google doesn’t use meta keywords in its ranking algorithm at all, because they’re too easy to abuse.

## Title Tag

- most important of all of the meta tags
- You’ll find them in the search results page and at the top of your browser.
- This is particularly useful if you want to give the page one primary title for the user but want to clarify or simplify that information for SEO purposes and for the user who’s shuffling multiple tabs on their desktop.

## Meta Description Attribute

<meta name="description" content="Free Web tutorials for HTML and CSS">

- The meta description is a useful meta tag as, very simply, it explains to search engines and (sometimes) searchers themselves what your page is about.
- It’s important to note that the meta description tag won’t always show up in the results for a Google search (Google frequently picks a snippet of text from the page itself) but it’s useful in other ways.
- Google has also stated that keywords in meta descriptions won’t affect your rankings. However, a compelling meta description tag could entice searchers to click through from the SERP to your site, especially if the description includes the keywords they were searching for. And a strong click-through rate from the SERP could indirectly improve your rankings.

## Meta Robots Attribute

- With this attribute, you’re telling the search engines robots how to crawl, index and display a page's content.
- index/noindex – This tells the engines whether to show your page in search results or not.
- follow/nofollow – This tells the engines what to do with links on your pages: whether they should trust and “follow” your links to the next page or not.
